# Preface

Social media platforms have done great work in facilitating new connections between people. However, they are increasingly transforming into parasitic entities. Their primary goal is to enrich the platforms themselves, as well as their direct corporate and buerocratic stakeholders, oftentimes at the expense of the users they serve.

The damaging effects of social media are well documented and do not need to be reiterated in detail. They engage in activities such as:

- Banning/boosting content depending on whether it's amicable to the platforms stakeholders
- Using system designs that purposely maximize the addictive nature of the platform
- Needless warehousing of vast quantities of user data for questionable purposes

Numerous solutions have been tabled to purportedly "fix social media". However, they range from complete technological digressions (blockchain-based solutions), attempts to move the problem around rather than actually solve it (alternative social networks), and unscalable designs with unsolvable user experience issues (federated models).

These solutions are misguided. In order to put an end to the nefarious activities being carried out by the dominant social media platforms, each individual user must not only have soverign ownership over their own data, but also over the means by which it is distributed.

The purpose of this project is to introduce the concept of a network of "Social Media Micro-Platforms" into the public eye.

# What is A Social Media Micro-Platform?

A "Social Media Micro-Platform" is a social media platform that only has a single user, and this user is the sole owner, operator, and manager of the platform.

Of course, with this description, a reasonable objection could be: "how is this different from a blog?"

The most visible difference is that today's blogging engines (WordPress, Ghost) are purpose built for high-effort, long-form articles. While this is certainly of value, this isn't the kind of content that dominates social media: captioned images, short video clips, and concise text posts.
